## 💻 Project

A game entirely made in JavaScript inspired by the famous <a href="https://flappybird.io/4">Flappy Bird</a> game, in which the objective is to avoid obstacles by directing the doll with the arrow keys.
Its architecture was made in html and css, using canvas, very good for creating games and dimensioning divs and tags, besides a better flexibility with css interaction for movements and collisions
